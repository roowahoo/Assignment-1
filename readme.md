# Strategy
## Site owner's goals: 
To raise awareness of the major crimes that took place in Singapore that is known for being one of the safest countries in the world to live in.
Also, to shed light on current and cold cases of missing people in Singapore and to provide a channel for reporting new cases. 
# Users: 
1.General public
2.Friends/family members of missing people  
## User's goals: 
For the general public, it would be to be aware and watch out for their own safety which can be very easily taken for granted considering we
are living in Singapore where laws and punishments for offenders are strictly enforced.

Apart from being aware of the chances of becoming a victim of crime themselves, there is a need for a convenient one-stop place to visit
for current missing people reports that do not make it to major news outlets. They can then be on a look out for these missing people who
happened to be last seen in their vicinity.

For friends/family members of missing people, they would want to reach a wider audience(other parts of the world) in the search for
their loved ones especially when their case do not make it to the news headlines.
